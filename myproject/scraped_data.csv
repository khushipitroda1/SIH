Government should reconsider Agnipath scheme: Hooda,http://www.ptinews.com//news/13449102_Government-should-reconsider-Agnipath-scheme--Hooda.html,"Chandigarh, Jun 15 (PTI) Senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre over its ""Agnipath"" scheme, saying it neither favours the the country nor the youth.He requested the government to reconsider and rationalise it by ensuring permanent jobs to soldiers who complete their four-year term in the armed forces. The Centre on Tuesday unveiled the ambitious ""Agnipath"" scheme for recruitment of the youth aged between 17 and a half and 21 in the Army, Navy and the Air Force, largely on a four-year short-term contractual basis. 
 The youth recruited under the scheme will be known as 'Agniveers'. After the completion of the four-year tenure, 25 per cent of the recruits from each specific batch will be offered regular service. ""It has far-reaching consequences and these have not been fully considered while preparing this scheme. In the long run, the policy would have a detrimental impact on our national security,"" Hooda claimed in a statement here. ""It seems the government is compromising with the security of the country with the intention of saving money on salary, pension, gratuity and halving the strength of the armed forces,"" the former Haryana chief minister alleged.Hooda claimed that a large number of youth have become overage due to the closure of Army recruitment for the past three years due to the Covid pandemic.""The hopes of the youth who had been waiting for the Army recruitment for the last many years and also those who had given written examination, physical test for Army recruitment and were waiting for the results have been dashed after the implementation of this new policy,"" he said. 
 The Congress leader demanded that the government should consider giving relaxation in age limit to the youth who have become overage in the past three years. 
 Counting the shortcomings of the scheme, Hooda said 75 per cent of the soldiers who will be recruited in the army as Agniveers will be retired after four years. 
 ""No care has been taken about what will happen to their future. This plan does not live up to the tradition, nature, morals and values of the Army,"" he said.""The period of training prescribed under the scheme is insufficient. Insufficient training can have a negative impact on the capability and effectiveness of the military. With just four years of service, the Army will start being treated as a tourist organisation,"" he claimed.
 Hooda, who is Leader of Opposition in the Haryana Assembly, said regimental honour is very strong part of the tradition of our armed forces and recruits would lose their attachment to the name, insignia and the emotional connect with the regiment. 
 ""The government is talking about giving a lumpsum amount of Rs 11.71 lakh as a service fund to the Agniveers who will be forced out from the Army after four years while the truth is that only half of this fund belongs to the government and half will be the money of the soldiers' earnings,"" he said.
 He asked the government to clearly answer if an Agniveer, who is unemployed after four years of service, will be able to spend his entire life with Rs 11.71 lakh. 
 ""They will get neither pension, military hospital nor canteen facility after four years of service,"" he said. 
 The army of the youth who have completed four years of service will be forced to search for jobs, he said.
 ""Such unemployed youth who know how to use weapons can easily be misled, which can prove to be a serious threat to society. I urge the government to reconsider this scheme and take a decision keeping in mind the larger interest of the country and society,"" he said.",National,Jun 15 19:3 HRS IST
New York state to protect abortion providers under new laws,http://www.ptinews.com//news/13444520_New-York-state-to-protect-abortion-providers-under-new-laws.html,"Albany (US), Jun 14 (AP) New York has expanded legal protections for people seeking and providing abortions in the state under legislation signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday. The Democratic governor pushed for the laws in anticipation of the US Supreme Court potentially overruling its 1973 Roe v. Wade's decision, which established a constitutional right to abortion. A ruling that could weaken or end abortion protections is expected as early as this week, and abortion providers are worried New York will see a surge in out-of-state residents. Today, we are taking action to protect our service providers from the retaliatory actions of anti-abortion states and ensure that New York will always be a safe harbor for those seeking reproductive healthcare,"" Hochul said.Out-of-state residents accounted for nearly 9% or 7,000 out of roughly 79,000 abortions performed in New York in 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's up from 5% or roughly 4,700 out of 93,000 in 2015.One new law protects abortion providers from arrest, extradition and legal proceedings in other states by forbidding New York state and local courts and law enforcement agencies from cooperating in most scenarios. 
Under another law, people could sue for unlawful interference with their right to reproductive health care when other people or entities bring civil or criminal charges against them for seeking, accessing or providing abortions.And at a time when patients can receive virtual care, another new law will prevent insurers from taking action against New York health care providers who perform reproductive services that are illegal elsewhere.The state's health commissioner will also study the unmet health needs of pregnant women and the impact of unlicensed centers that offer some pregnancy services and persuade women against abortion.The laws protecting abortion providers and care take effect immediately.In 90 days, another new law will begin allowing abortion providers and patients to participate in an existing state program that lets people shield their address.The National Abortion Federation says death threats against abortion providers more than doubled from 92 in 2019 to 200 in 2020.Hochul also plans to give abortion providers 
35 million to expand services and boost security for abortion providers because of the expected Supreme Court ruling.Lawmakers enshrined Roe v. Wade into state law in 2019, and Hochul wants to enshrine it in the state constitution.The state constitution prohibits discrimination based onrace, color, creed or religion. 
Civil liberties groups and abortion providers have proposed an amendment prohibiting discrimination based on factors ranging frompregnancy and pregnancy outcomesto sex and gender identity.The Legislature must approve any amendment in two legislative session years before sending it to voters.Lawmakers would likely need to start the process in August to send it to voters in 2023. I can't say that'll happen, but I'm open minded, Hochul said Monday.New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman saidright-wingcritics are stalling passage by arguing the proposed amendment would infringe religious liberties.",International,Jun 14 10:21 HRS IST

Plea in SC to ascertain feasibility of enacting stringent population control law,http://www.ptinews.com//news/13448441_Plea-in-SC-to-ascertain-feasibility-of-enacting-stringent-population-control-law.html,"New Delhi, Jun 15 (PTI) A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Centre to ascertain the feasibility of enacting a stringent population control law to secure fundamental rights for citizens.The plea filed by spiritual orator Devkinandan Thakur said there is a need to control the population explosion to secure the basic rights of the citizens as this is the root cause of all the problems. ""The facts constituting the cause of action accrued on December 10, 2020, when the Centre said that it is against the forcing of family planning and won't take coercion action. Centre passed its obligation though 'Population Control & Family Planning' is mentioned in the concurrent list. Hence Centre can make laws and regulation policies to control population explosion, which is the biggest menace to democracy and socio-economic development. It has not even drafted a Bill till date. ""The injury caused to citizens, particularly women, is extremely large. The perils of population explosion on the economy and its ramifications are often discussed. But, the impact that repeated childbearing has on women are seldom highlighted outside the niche areas. Incidence of grand multiparity, which is defined as more than 4 viable births, in developing countries like India is 20 per cent while it is only 2 per cent in developed countries,"" the plea filed through advocate Ashutosh Dubey said. The plea has submitted that the right to clean air, drinking water, health, and livelihood guaranteed under Articles 21-21A, can't be secured to all citizens without effective population control. It has also sought directions to the Law Commission of India to examine the population control laws and population control policies of the developed countries and suggest steps in order to secure the fundamental rights. The Centre in another petition had earlier told the top court that India is unequivocally against forcing family planning on its people and any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter-productive and leads to demographic distortions. In an affidavit filed in the top court, the health ministry had said that the family welfare programme in the country is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt family planning methods best suited to them, according to their choice and without any compulsion. The submission was made in response to a PIL filed by lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay challenging a Delhi High Court order that dismissed a plea seeking certain steps, including the two-child norm, to control the country's growing population.",Legal,Jun 15 16:30 HRS IST

In another development, Hardik Pandya is likely to captain the white-ball squad in England as Rishabh Pant, who is currently leading the T20 side, will join the Indian Test squad in UK only after the South Africa series. ""Rahul has not recovered from his groin injury. The Test squad members are assembling in Mumbai today and will fly out midnight. Rahul is not travelling with the team. He will take some more time to recover although he might appear in a fitness test during weekend. Chances of recovery aren't looking bright,"" a BCCI official privy to development told PTI on the condition of anonymity. All the players, except Pant, are leaving for England early Thursday for the July 1-5 contest, notable being skipper Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. It is understood that since there is only one Test match, which is a spill-over from the 2021 series, the selectors are still not thinking about KL Rahul's replacement as of now. ""You have Shubman Gill, who has opened in most of his Test matches. Else, Cheteshwar Pujara can also open the batting, in case there is any fitness issues for any of the two openers.

 It has been decided that Pant will not be playing the two T20 Internationals against Ireland and hence Hardik, who is his deputy for the South Africa series, is expected to lead the side. ""While there is Dinesh Karthik, who is the senior-most player in the squad along with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, it was Hardik, who was Pant's designated deputy and hence favourite to lead,"" the official added. In Pant's absence, India have two keepers in Ishan Kishan and Karthik in the squad.
